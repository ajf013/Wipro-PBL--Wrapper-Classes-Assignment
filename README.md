 Write a java program which generates the minimum and maximum value for each of the Numeric Wrapper classes (Byte, Short, nteger, Long, Float, Double)

Sample Output:
Integer range: 
min: -2147483648 
max: 2147483647 
Double range: 
min: 4.9E-324 
max: 1.7976931348623157E308 
Long range: 
min: -9223372036854775808 
max: 9223372036854775807 
Short range: 
min: -32768 
max: 32767 
Byte range: 
min: -128 
max: 127 
Float range: 
min: 1.4E-45 
max: 3.4028235E38

 Accept a integer number as Command line argument from the program and when the program is executed print the binary, octal and hexadecimal equivalent of the given number.

Sample Output:

java  Test 20
Given Number :20
Binary equivalent :10100
Octal equivalent :24
Hexadecimal equivalent :14

Refer Java Documentation and look for the appropriate Wrapper class method

 Define a java class that accepts an integer(between 1 and 255) from the user and displays the String representation of the argument passed as an unsigned integer in base 2. The output displayed should contain 8 digits and should be padded with leading 0s(zeros), in case the returned String contains less than 8 characters.

For example, if the user enters the value 16, then the output should be

00010000

and if the user enters the value 100, the output should be

01100100

You are expected to use Integer class conversion method/s described in the PDF file. Use Scanner class to accept user inputs.(Hint : You may use String.format() method for the expected output)
